## Getting started

See examples with comments in [examples/README.md](examples/README.md)

### Create Provider instance

Use the API key and secret to access your B2BinPay account:

```php
$provider = new B2Binpay\Provider(
    'API_KEY',
    'API_SECRET'
);
``` 

#### Test Mode

In order to use testing sandbox, pass `true` as a third parameter for `B2Binpay\Provider`:

```php
$provider = new B2Binpay\Provider(
    'API_KEY',
    'API_SECRET',
    true
);
``` 

**Warning:** Sandbox and main gateway have their own pairs of key and secret!

### Create a bill

_The payment currency is considered to match the currency of your wallet_.

Create a new bill:

```php
$bill = $provider->createBill(  
        'WALLET_ID',
        'AMOUNT',
        'CURRENCY',
        'LIFETIME',
        'TRACKING_ID',
        'CALLBACK_URL',
        'SUCCESS_URL',
        'ERROR_URL'
  );
```
| Params | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WALLET_ID | (int) Each wallet is responsible for creating bill only in the currency assigned to it |
| AMOUNT | (string) Amount in the value of the currency being created |
| CURRENCY | (string) See list of supported currencies in the table above |
| LIFETIME | (int) Number in seconds that will set bill to expire from the current creation date |
| TRACKING_ID | (string) _Optional_. Track for bill tracking. This value will be returned on callback |
| CALLBACK_URL | (string) _Optional_. URL to which the callback will be sent |
| SUCCESS_URL | (string) _Optional_. URL to which the user can be sent after successful payment, is used only on the payment page |
| ERROR_URL | (string) _Optional_. URL to which the user can be sent after unsuccessful payment, is used only on the payment page |

### Convert currency

You can get actual rates and convert supported currencies respecting your wallet's parameters.

Get rates for _BASE_CURRENCY_:

```php
$rates = $provider->getRates('BASE_CURRENCY', 'RATE_TYPE');
```
| Params | Description |
| --- | --- |
| BASE_CURRENCY | (string) *Optional*. Currency to which the rates will be calculated. Default: USD |
| RATE_TYPE | (string) *Optional*. Receiving the type of rates, for **deposit** and **withdrawal**. Default: deposit  |

Convert currency using actual rates:

```php
$amount = $provider->convertCurrency('AMOUNT', 'BASE_CURRENCY', 'CURRENCY', $rates);
```
| Params | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AMOUNT | (string) The amount in the currency to be converted |
| BASE_CURRENCY | (string) The currency in which the amount is indicated  |
| CURRENCY | (string) Currency in which you want to convert the amount |
| $rates | (array) _Optional_. Current rates. If the parameter is not specified, then the rates will be requested again |

Now you can provide `$amount` variable as a second parameter for `createBill()` method to set an accurate amount of cryptocurrency.

### Add markup

You can add some markup to the existing amount.

Set _10%_ markup for the current amount:

```php
$amount = $provider->addMarkup($amount, 'CURRENCY', 10);
```
| Params | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $amount | (string) Amount to add markup |
| CURRENCY | (string) Currency in which markup is added |
| 10 | (int) Percentage on which to add markup |

### Callback

Once bill status changed, our server can send a callback to your configured Callback URL. Also, you can specify Tracking ID, which will return with the callback to identify the exact order.
To do that provide additional parameters to `createBill()` method:

```php
$bill = $provider->createBill(
        'WALLET_ID',
        $amount,
        'CURRENCY',
        'LIFETIME',
        '202009051801',
        'https://my.callback.url/callback.php'
    );
```

**Warning:** If specified, your Callback URL should return the message "OK" with status 200. Until that payment will not be considered complete!

```php
header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK');
exit('OK');
```

#### Callback verification

You can verify Callback request headers by comparing it with the `$provider->verifySign()` method output:

```php
$verifySign = $provider->verifySign($_POST['sign']['time'], $_POST['sign']['hash']);
if (!$verifySign) {
    header('HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized');
    exit();
}
```
****WARNING:**** for each callback `$ _POST ['sign'] ['hash']` a new one is generated - if you received `$ _POST ['sign'] ['hash']` which was already used before, you should throw the same error as for signature verification
